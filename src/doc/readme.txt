README for ashkelon
===================

Thanks for downloading ashkelon!

1. For an ashkelon users' guide, see guide.html or guide/index.html

2. To learn how to configure & setup ashkelon and to get
   it up and running, see the file: install.txt

3. For an idea of where this project is going, see todo.txt and roadmap.txt

4. After you have gotten ashkelon configured and working,
   read apis/readme.txt as a supplement.

5. Database support:  ashkelon currently supports mysql,
   postgres, and oracle.  this app was designed to make adding
   support for other sql dialects relatively painless.
   contributions on this front are encouraged.

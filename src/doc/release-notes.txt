Release Notes

What's new in v0.8.6 (July ? 2004):
----------------------------------

 - Made handling of @link references (inline tags) during population an 
  extension point for other systems that derive from Ashkelon.  Ashkelon
  currently replaces these references to urls it needs for its web-based
  UIs (Now in AshkelonTagResolver)

 - Merged in a fix that Matt Schmidt provided regarding the handling of inline tags 
  in return descriptions

 - Noticed resin having an issue with certain c:import tags.  Replaced with jsp:include

 - Started updating mechanism for producing documentation to work with the latest
  version of the ant docbook styler, to be able to produce pdf docs in addition
  to html.  This is not yet complete

 - Re-implemented view source feature.  This version is much more performant
  and pluggable.  Have two alternative implementations, using two independent
  java2html libraries.  Algorithm will now cache the html file on disk in
  the web app so that subsequent requests for view source do not require 
  reprocessing the source file.

 - Fix "ashkelon remove" on mysql.  Database table names are case-sensitive on
  Unix

What's new in v0.8.5 (July 7 2004):
----------------------------------

 - Updated mysql jdbc driver to v3.0.14
 - Much refactoring has been done:
    * The controller servlet is simpler
    * The HTML pages are simpler, more consistent and more pleasant
      (though additional refactoring of pages is planned for even further
       streamlining)
 - Dynamic HTML now mostly usable with the Safari browser (in addition to 
     previous support for Mozilla and Internet Explorer)
    though a few issues remain to be addressed for full Safari support
 - Simple class search now really is on the header of every page (for quick access)
 - Some cosmetic ui changes to DHTML ui (legend moved to header)
 - Started to add first widget allowing end user to toggle whether to constrain block
    heights and scroll (so everything fits on a page) or whether to just let blocks
    occupy as much vertical space as they need (and scroll the entire page).  See for
    example the J2SE API packages list (assuming you've populated J2SE in your 
    repository)


What's new in v0.8.4 (May 20 2004):
---------------------------------

 This release strictly modifies project documentation, not
  project codebase.

 1. Serious revamping of project documentation
   a. content expanded, updated, corrected
   b. documentation now written in docbook xml, currently producing html

 2. ApiXml tool/utility now more easily callable (added shell script
     in bin/ ) to produce api xml files to feed to ashkelon

What's new in v0.8.3 (May 2004):
--------------------

 1. Class Search Field on every page
 2. JSTL libs included with distro (simpler install)
 3. Switch to GPL

What's new in v0.8.2: (2003)
---------------------
 1. Small but important fix to conn pooling:  on error pool is now flushed/
    reset/discarded.
 2. Finally:  Ant task for running ashkelon from Ant (thanks to bob)
 3. Other miscellaneous bug fixes.

What's new in v0.8.1:
---------------------

 Note: don't let the subversion increment fool you.  0.8.1 represents a major
  upgrade from 0.8.0.  I am now conserving on version numbers because of 
  the number of features I want the product to include by the time ashkelon
  reaches v1.0

 Back-end
 - Ashkelon now supports PostgresQL

 Refactoring
 - Directory Structure for codebase reworked
 - All references to dbdoc replaced with 'ashkelon', the open-source name of the product
 - packaging of java codebase now org.ashkelon instead of com.u2d.dbdoc
 - url mapping improved, now uses suffix like struts does (.do) instead of passing
    action name in query string

 UI
 - Authors section added as top-level menu
 - Authors are now styled, like other entities are
 - API page improved with tabbed pane, to conform to look and feel of package and class pages
 - rendering in Mozilla improved

 Documentation
 - ERD diagram (pdf) added, now documents schema

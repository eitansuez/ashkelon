<H2>Pages</H2>

<P>
dbdoc consists of a number of different types of pages.  A dbdoc repository
may consist of a few thousand classes.  Regardless which class one looks up,
the basic layout for viewing pages that describe classes is the same.  This
section discusses the various types of pages that you will encounter, how
they are presented visually on the page, and how a user interacts with them.
</P>

<P>
These are the main page types in dbdoc:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>package pages</LI>
<LI>class or interface pages</LI>
<LI>member pages</LI>
<LI>author pages</LI>
</UL>

<H3>Package Pages</H3>

<P>The page body for a package page consists of up to six (6) tabs.  The
first always contains the package description and a listing of all of
the package's members grouped by type (ordinary class, interface, exception
classes, and error classes).  These are all color coded to distinguish
them easily from each other.</P>

<P>The next four tabs are slightly more detailed views of each of the
four types of package members (classes and interfaces).  Each tab
contains a listing of the members of that type (say interface types)
along with a brief description of each.  One can easily drill down
to an individual class or interface by simply clicking on the type
name (the are all hyperlinks to class or interface pages).</P>

<P>The last tab is called the package tree.  The package tree is
the assembly of the class inheritance hierarchy for all classes and
interfaces that are members of the given package.  The tree is dynamically
expandable and collapsible, allowing a degree of interaction with the
end user.  Class or interface type color codes are maintained even in
the tree view.</P>

<H3>Class or Interface Pages</H3>

<P>
Class information for a given class is divided into up to seven tabs.
The first contains a description of the class or interface, along with
peripheral information such as author, version, package membership, 
implemented interfaces list, superclass information, "since" information,
and "see also" references.  The second tab contains a brief listing
of the class's or interface's members (fields, constructors, methods).
The following three tabs are expanded views for each subset member 
(field, constructor, method) category.  The Methods tab for example
lists all methods along with brief descriptions of each.  All elements
are hyperlinks to more detailed pages for each member.</P>

<P>Next is the inheritance tree (list of all superclasses) for the 
given class and is self-explanatory.  The last tab is the cross 
references tab which provides ways for users to discover cross 
reference interrelationships between the given class and other
classes.  The list of cross references varies slightly based on 
whether one is inspecting an ordinary class, an exception class,
or an interface.  For interfaces, there is the 'implemented by'
relationship where one can discover all classes in the repository
that implement the specific interface.  For exceptions, there is
the 'thrown by' cross reference which can be used to discover all
the methods and constructors that throw this particular type of
exception.  In addition, there are the following cross references:

<UL>
<LI>fields: discover what class fields are defined to be of the 
given class or interface type</LI>
<LI>returned by: discover what methods return an object of the
given type</LI>
<LI>passed to:  discover what methods require parameters of the
given type</LI>
<LI>subclasses: discover all classes that immediately extend
the given type.</LI>
<LI>descendents: displays a tree of all classes in the repository
that are either immediate or indirect subclasses of the given
type.</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<P>What is especially useful about cross references is that they
span the entire dbdoc repository.  This means that the results
of cross reference lookups become span all the APIs that exist
in the repository.  If a new API is added to the repository at
a later time, these additional cross references will be discovered.
</P>

<P>Cross references can be a powerful means of discovering important
relationships that exist between programming elements that otherwise
would not be obvious.  They're useful for discovering 
how to instantiate (or obtain a reference to) specific class types
that use factory methods (and not constructors) that usually exist
in a different class.</P>


<H3>Member Pages</H3>

<P>For field types, field pages display the field's name, type, modifiers,
documentation (description information), and possible a list of references
to related items.
</P>

<P>For method and constructor types, if a method or constructor is overloaded,
then all overloaded variants will be displayed on the same page for the
purpose of enabling the end user to quickly compare and contrast different
versions of the same executable member (method or constructor).</P>

<P>Standard information display for methods or constructors include the 
member's signature (modifiers, parameters, return types), class membership,
package membership, description information, parameter description information,
return (for methods) type information, and if the method or constructor throws
an exception, a listing and description of the various exceptions thrown.</P>

<P>When mehods are overloaded, multiple signatures are displayed.  Each signature
can be used to toggle the page view from one variant's detail information to
another's.  By going back and forth
between two or three (or more) variants, one can quickly discern the differences
between each version of the method or constructor and determine which is the
most appropriate variant to use.</P>

<H3>Author Pages</H3>

<P>
Author pages (at present) are very simple.  They simply consist
of the author name (sometimes their email address), and a listing
of the classes and interfaces that the author has either authored
or co-authored.
</P>

<P>I hope that author information will grow to include more information
in a future version (email address, and perhaps author background description).
</P>

<H2>Overview</H2>

<P>dbdoc is intended to be used as an online reference by software developers writing Java software.
</P>

<P>We must first ask the question: what exactly is being referenced?  The constructs of Java programs, which are themselves Java programs, which primarily consist of: packages, classes, interfaces, and members.
</P>

<P>The next question is:  what are the main interrelationships between these entitites?  Packages contain classes and interfaces.  Some classes implement interfaces and also inherit properties and behavior from other classes.  Classes and interfaces in turn contain members.  Members can be field properties, constructors, and methods.  Each entity has many properties such as access modifiers and other modifiers (static, abstract, etc..).
</P>

<P>
One quality of a useful reference is the ability to look up information using a variety of methods.
dbdoc indeed has many entry points:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>
  classes, members, and interfaces can be looked up directly by name or portion thereof
</LI>
<LI>
  the index can be used to lookup packages, classes, members, or authors alphabetically
</LI>
<LI>
  entities can be looked up by drilling down from package down to class or interface and further still down to the member level
</LI>
<LI>
  entities can also be discovered by using the class and interface cross reference system
</LI>
<LI>
  the number of interrelationships between entities is significant.  Hyperlinks between pages provide the ability to rapidly switch from one entity's documentation to another's.
</LI>
</UL>
  
<P>
Another important quality of dbdoc is its ability to serve as a learning tool for novice programmers (in addition to its ability to be a powerful reference system for experienced developers).  Features such as dynamically collapsible inheritance trees allow developers unfamiliar with certain packages to visualize intricate (and significant) class inheritance interrelationships.
</P>

<P>
A developer can take a number of different paths to navigate dbdoc to look up documentation and to discover new information about existing software libraries.  dbdoc provides a way for developers to inspect and analyze software in a manner that allows him to extract much useful information.

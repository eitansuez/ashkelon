<H2>User Interface Components</H2>

<P>
The dbdoc user interface re-uses several important user interface components
that facilitate an end user's ability to view and filter information.
A handful of such components are used consistently across the entire system.
Knowledge of how to interpret and interact with these few components is
fundamental to understanding how to view, use, and interact with the various
pages that you will encounter in dbdoc.  Some components are very basic 
(such as tooltips) and very commonly used.  Others are more complex and
specialized to specific programming elements.
</P>

<P>
The following are the main user interface components that dbdoc is comprised
of:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Tab Sets</LI>

<LI>Collapsible Trees</LI>

<LI>Tool Tips</LI>

<LI>Scrollable Lists</LI>

<LI>Class and Member Listings</LI>

<LI>Overloaded Method and Constructor Selector</LI>
</UL>

<P>The behavior and usage of each component is further discussed below.</P>

<H3>Tab Sets</H3>

<P>
Tab Sets are a graphical user interface components that enable
the display of large amounts of information on a relatively
small visible area.  Instead of listing information on a single
long page, the information is categorized into tabs.  At any one
time, only one tab's information is viewable while the others are
hidden from view.  Clicking on a tab header will hide the previous
tab's information from view and instead display the information 
corresponding to the newly clicked tab.
</P>

<P>
The tab headers are usually displayed in a manner that resembles
a traditional filing cabinet where the manila folder tabs stick 
out of the top or side.
</P>

<P><B>Where used</B>:  main index page, main stats page, search page, package pages, class and 
interface pages.</P>

<P><B>Example</B>: package pages need to display much information.  If you drill down to 
a specific package such as java.awt, you will see that the package information
is distributed over a set of six (6) tabs: java.awt, classes, interfaces,
exceptions, errors, and tree (package tree view).  Click on any of these
tabs to switch between the various views that make up the java.awt package
page.</P>

<H3>Collapsible Trees</H3>

<P>
Collapsible trees are a method of viewing information that is hierarchically
related.  One interacts with these components by expanding or collapsing
any of the nodes in the tree to display or hide the children of that
given node.
</P>

<P>
In dbdoc, collapsible trees are used to display the hierarchical inheritance
interrelationships that exist among classes and interfaces.  These trees are 
collapsible and
expandable, allowing an end user to filter out certain branches, allowing
the end user to focus on specific inheritance relationships and thus gain
knowledge of class interrelationships.
</P>

<P><B>Where used</B>:  used to display and interact with package trees
(package trees combine the inheritance hierarchy of all classes that
are members of that package into one navigable tree), class inheritance,
class descendents cross referencing.  See the <I>Tree</I> tabs on package
and class pages and the cross reference tab for class pages.</P>

<P><B>Example</B>: say you wanted to study the inheritance hierarchy
in the design of the java.io package.  Specifically, the java.io.InputStream
hierarchy.  Navigate to the java.io packge, select the <I>Tree</I> tab.  Find
and click on the InputStream class, click on the <I>Cross Reference</I> tab,
and select "descendents."  This will display a filtered tree of all
the descendants of InputStream.  Important discoveries for programmers new
to this package is that the class FilterInputStream is a common ancestor
for various specialized inputstreams such as JarInputStream and 
BufferedInputStream.</P>


<H3>Tool Tips</H3>

<P>
Tool Tips have become a very common user interface component that are very helpful
in assisting end users discover more information about a specific item displayed
on a screen where there would otherwise be no room to display the entire information.
One hovers over an item using the mouse pointing device and useful information
will appear over the item, usually describing it in more detail.
</P>

<P>
In dbdoc, Tool Tips are used in package listings to provide a brief description
of a package, in class listings (also to provide a brief description for a class
or interface), and again in member listings to provide a brief description of
the member in question.
</P>

<P><B>Example</B>: Select <B>Search</B> from the menu bar and perform a direct
lookup of the class <I>String</I> by typing "String" in the name field and 
pressing the "Go" button.  The String class (package java.lang) will appear.
Select the "Members" tab and hover over the method named "concat".  A tooltip will
appear displaying the method description:  "Concatenates the specified string
to the end of this string."
</P>

<H3>Scrollable Lists</H3>

<P>
Many of the pages on the dbdoc user interface contain listings.  Package
pages contain listings of member classes while class pages contain
member listings of methods, fields, and constructors.  These listings will
often be very lengthy and extensive.  A good example is the java.awt package
which contains dozens of classes.  The list of classes can simply be displayed
on the page.  The end user can use the page's scrollbar to scroll up and
down the page to view different sections of these lengthy lists.  However,
while scrolling, the header and footer information will disappear from view,
forcing the user to scroll back to the top or bottom in order to proceed
with navigation.  This is tedious and annoying.  Scrolling lists allow only
the listing to scroll within a limited area on the page.  By using scrolling
lists, the header and footer never disappear from view and so no penalty
is incurred.
</P>


<H3>Class and Member Listings</H3>

<P>
dbdoc uses two custom components for listing classes and members (such as methods).
These components are essentially tables where different columns are used
to provide useful modifier information about a class or member.  Common modifiers
are abstract and static.  The main interactive feature of Class and Member
listings is that they provide a way for end users to filter the listing
to display only records that match a specific modifier.  For example, if you
navigate to the class page for the class java.lang.ClassLoader and click on
the tab labeled "Methods", you will see a method listing in the page body.
If you happened to only be interested in static method members of the
class ClassLoader, you can simply click on the header column for that
modifier (labeled "static") and all non-static members will be promptly
filtered out (will disappear from the listing), thus allowing you to
focus on static members.  This step can be repeated to display only
final, deprecated, public, or abstract members of ClassLoader.
</P>

<H3>Overloaded Method and Constructor Selector</H3>

<P>
When looking up documentation for a Method or a Constructor, one will
often refer back and forth between several variants of the same method.
The more common term for these variants is 'overloaded methods.'
Basically overloaded methods or constructors all have the same names
but their parameter signatures differ.  Take for example the java.lang.String
constructor.  It has elevent (11) variants.  Drill down to the String constructor
by navigating to the String class, selecting the 'members' tab and clicking
on any of the eleven constructor references in the listing.
</P>

<P>
The Selector component is specialized for viewing, comparing and contrasting
various overloaded variants of the same method.  The method signatures and
parameter arguments are displayed on the left side of the page.  By selecting
any of the listed method or constructor variants, the corresponding description
will appear on the right hand side of the page.  By going back and forth
between two or three (or more) variants, one can quickly discern the differences
between each version of the method or constructor and determine which is the
most appropriate variant to use.

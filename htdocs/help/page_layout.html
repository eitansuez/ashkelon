<H2>Basic Page Layout</H2>

<P>
dbdoc's user interface has a uniform basic page layout.  All pages follow 
this basic layout:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Main menu bar across top of page</LI>
<LI>Navigation Trail Bar immediately below menu bar</LI>
<LI>Page body</LI>
<LI>Page footer with a reference to the style legend for the system</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Another uniform aspect of the system is the use of <SPAN STYLE="color: red">color coding</SPAN>
and <I>styles</I> to represent each type of programming element that
comprises a Java API: packages, classes, interfaces, fields, constructors,
and methods.
</P>

<H3>Main Menu Bar</H3>

<P>
The menu bar consists of five buttons labeled: <B>Packages</B>, <B>Search</B>, <B>Index</B>, <B>Stats</B>, 
and <B>Help</B>.  The first three (<B>Packages</B>, <B>Search</B>, and <B>Index</B>) represent the three 
principal routes to accessing Java programming element information.

<OL>
<LI>
The first
(<B>Packages</B>) provides the traditional hierarchical or drill-down method of 
accessing elements.  The main page lists the APIs documented in the repository.
For each API, one can drill down to the set of packages that comprise that 
API.  For each package, one can view and access its components: classes and
interfaces that comprise that package.  Finally, for each class or interface,
its members (fields, constructors, and methods) can be accessed.  For a thorough 
description of each type of page, see the <a href="pages.html">pages</a> section.
</LI>

<LI>
The <B>Search</B> button provides a more direct method to access elements either
by name or via a combination of search parameters.  It is a very powerful method
of querying the underlying repository for class or member information.
</LI>

<LI>
The <B>Index</B> button provides access to packages, classes, members, and 
authors alphabetically, in a manner similar to what one might find in traditional
printed materials.
</LI>

<LI>The <B>Stats</B> button provides summary and statistical information about
the documentation currently in the repository, including package sizes in terms
of the number of classes and interfaces they contain, author statistics such as
the number of classes authored by each of the developers contributing to the
various APIs in the repository, and more.
</LI>

<LI>The <B>Help</B> button is a link to this documentation.
</LI>
</OL>

<H3>Navigation Trail</H3>

<P>
Often when using a reference (or any other kind of reference),
the end user will go back and forth from one topic to another usually because
these topics are interrelated and somehow reference each other.  The dbdoc
reference system is no exception.  The navigation trail remembers for you
the last ten (10) pages (or locations) that you have navigated to.  Each
is listed in the navigation trail bar and is accessible as a hyperlink.
You will find the navigation trail to be a simple and effective
method for navigating back and forth between a number of interrelated elements.
</P>

<H3>Page Body</H3>

<P>
The content of this section will vary across page types.  See the <a href="pages.html">pages</a> section for a description of each page body
by page type.
</P>


<H3>Footer</H3>

<P>
For users who are new to dbdoc, the footer of each page contains a button
labeled "Legend" which immediate provides access to a reference of the various color codes
and styles used to represent the various programming elements of Java APIs.
Use this legend freely when starting to use dbdoc to remind you what each
color code represents.
</P>

What are the things driving the To-Do list right now
----------------------------------------------------
There are plenty of important tasks to work on that would greatly 
increase the adoption of ashkelon.  Simpler installation, configuration,
tools, adding features, documenting the schema, support for other databases,
integration into tools like eclipse and gforge, more metrics, realizing
the vision of ashkelon serving as a way to measure [and have insight into]
your code in various ways.

Ashkelon To-Do List
-------------------

XP
 1. Write Unit Tests for Application and begin developing using
  test-first method

Refactoring
 1. Oracle version uses separate connect-by statements to generate
     inheritance trees.  Action: revise/refactor to use same solution
     other databases use

 2. Code that supports multiple GUIs forces data duplication.
   Refactor.  Proposed solution:  One set of JSPs generate the
   content to go on all versions of a page in XML format.
   Use separate XSLT transform to produce the different look
   and feel's.
    
 3. Modularize the build.xml file

 4. Review how application is configured and try to consolidate
    config files into a single file

 5. Review command line interface for ashkelon manager (populator) for
    possible improvements

 6. Refactor Model to use EJBs

Enhancements
 1. Build an ant task to run the ashkelon manager (populator).
 2. Support more databases (wider audience): hypersonicsql
 3. Support for multiple versions of APIs in a single repository. [hays]

Improvements
 1. Replace existing makeshift database connection pooling code with 
    a quality implementation that also handles refreshing stale connections.
    Use Jakarta's dbcp.

UI
 1. Improve usability of GUI and continue refactoring JSPs
 2. Port solution to use Struts (Under consideration)
   Current solution is MVC but author's own implementation.
 3. GUI Customeization:  Make packages page configurable so it
  can list packages of relevance to a specific business 
  environment [hays]
 4. Use JSTL in JSPs
 5. A third, XUL-based GUI
 6. Make DHTML look & feel work in Safari

Performance
 1. Replace current caching with a solid caching architecture
 2. Profile application

Major
 1. GUI for Ashkelon Manager (populator)
  a. Swing
  b. Web front-end
  c. Remote proxy (like cvs pserver et al)

 2. Integration with various IDEs
  a. Eclipse [hays]
  b. NetBeans
  c. JBuilder

 3. Integration with GForge
 (Add GForge support to automatically run ashkelon against a project
   and display the documentation as a link under the documentation item) [hays]

 4. Integration with Maven.  That is, make ashkelon a maven-enabled project
   so that code can be built using maven.  Also at some point might want to
   consider writing a maven plugin to the populator.
 
Add Value
 1. Integrate with open source measurement tools [hays]
 2. Add a referenced-by and references list [hays]

Ashkelon Completed List
-----------------------
1. Build Ant Scripts to build and deploy ashkelon on multiple platforms
2. Set up open source project at sourceforge.net so can leverage
   development & hosting tools such as mailing lists and cvs.
3. Build Mozilla-optimized set of JSPs (GUI)
4. Code repackaging away from com.u2d.dbdoc and to org.ashkelon
5. Pool Page classes
6. Postgresql support
7. Document the database structure (see doc/ERD.pdf)

Abandoned Ideas
---------------
1. Remove all references to PK's (primary keys) from URL's.  Reference 
   programming elements only by fully qualified names.
   
  reason abandoned:
   - url would get much longer
   - somewhat conflicts with multi-versioning feature (fully qualified
     name would not uniquely identify a programming element)

2. Gump Integration
  reason:  will focus on maven first.  will revisit gump later.

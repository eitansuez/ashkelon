Ashkelon To-Do List
-------------------

1. Build Ant Scripts to build and deploy ashkelon on multiple platforms
 [done! - thanks andreas!]

1.5 Set up open source project at sourceforge.net so can leverage
  development & hosting tools such as mailing lists and cvs.
  [done!]

2. Build a GUI for the ashkelon manager (populator).  Swing, web-based,
  other?

3. Integration with Gump project (see jakarta.apache.org)

4. Replace current caching with a solid caching architecture

5. Profile application

6. Plug security holes and invalid requests so they don't crash
   the app; examples:

     a. disallow building inheritance tree for class java.lang.Object ?
     b. check if programming element referenced in request is valid before
       attempting to fetch it from db and construct it

7. Postgresql support (basically, add lines to config\statements.properties)
  [80%]

8. Remote-enable the ashkelon manager so it can be run from remote machines.
   Analogous to how cvs clients can do checkins from other machines.

9. Remove all references to PK's (primary keys) from URL's.  Reference 
  programming elements only by fully qualified names.

10. Replace existing makeshift database connection pooling code with 
    a quality implementation that also handles refreshing stale connections.

11. Streamline configuration of app so that all config files use xml
  (no more properties files) using Castor

12. Review command line interface for ashkelon manager (populator) for
   possible improvements

13. Possibly pool Page classes

14. Possibly port solution to use Struts

15. Build a ashkelon plugin for eclipse or forte

16. Build JUnit Unit Tests

17. Review entire GUI and come up with improvements to the UI,
    its design, and usability.  Add more GUI widgets: toolbars,
    context menus, HTC's.

18. Build a Netscape 6 - optimized set of JSPs (GUI) [done!]

19. Inheritance Trees Logic is different for mysql than for Oracle.
   Oracle version uses separate connect-by statements; unify solution 
   to use single method that is currently used by mysql

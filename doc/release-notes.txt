Release Notes

What's new in v0.8.1:
---------------------

 Note: don't let the subversion increment fool you.  0.8.1 represents a major
  upgrade from 0.8.0.  I am now conserving on version numbers because of 
  the number of features I want the product to include by the time ashkelon
  reaches v1.0

 Back-end
 - Ashkelon now supports PostgresQL

 Refactoring
 - Directory Structure for codebase reworked
 - All references to dbdoc replaced with 'ashkelon', the open-source name of the product
 - packaging of java codebase now org.ashkelon instead of com.u2d.dbdoc
 - url mapping improved, now uses suffix like struts does (.do) instead of passing
    action name in query string

 UI
 - Authors section added as top-level menu
 - Authors are now styled, like other entities are
 - API page improved with tabbed pane, to conform to look and feel of package and class pages
 - rendering in Mozilla improved

 Documentation
 - ERD diagram (pdf) added, now documents schema

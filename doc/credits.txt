  Conceived, designed, & built by Eitan Suez,
  Austin, Texas (www.u2d.com).
  
  Sincere thanks goes to the following persons:

  Andreas Schaefer (of JBoss fame)
  for his energy, for writing the initial ant build file for
  this project, and for being the first individual
  to step up to the plate and actively contribute
  to this project.

  Bob Hays (alephnaught.com)
  for actively helping on the project, contributing
  a number of patches and features, including an ashkelon
  ant task (coming in v 0.8.2)

  Ben Walding who is working on a maven plugin for ashkelon
  and who planted the idea in my mind to write a maven
  POM file for ashkelon (maybe v 0.9)

  Conceived, designed, & built by Eitan Suez,
  Austin, Texas (www.uptodata.com).
  
  Sincere thanks goes to Andreas Schaefer for his
  energy, for writing the ant build file for
  this project, and for being the first individual
  to step up to the plate and actively contribute
  to this project.

  A thank you also goes to Bob Hayes (alephnaught.com)
  for actively ramping up on this project on his own 
  and already contributing a patch that reworks the
  packages page logic.

ashkelon documentation
----------------------

[October 14 2002 / Eitan Suez]
[Updated May 2003]

overview
--------

ashkelon is an open source project.  it is a java api documentation
tool designed for java developers.  its goals are the same as the goals
of the well-known javadoc tool that comes with j2se, whose gui most
java developers are quite familiar with (url for javadoc tool from
sun microsystems is: http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/ if you'd like
to learn more about javadoc)

ashkelon addresses the following issues that javadoc does not:

  - ashkelon is a multi-api documentation system, unlike javadoc
    which produces single-api documentation
    
  - ashkelon's documentation system leverages sql to provide a 
    queriable/searchable repository for documentation
    
  - the dhtml gui produced by ashkelon (which works with mozilla 1.x
     or ie 5.x or ie 6.x browsers) is markedly different from the

  - ashkelon's gui is a java web application, not a set of static
     html pages
     
the javadoc tool is composed of two parts:

  1. the documentation generator, used to produce html 
     (or other) documentation
  2. a graphical user interface used to browse and peruse
      through the documentation (static html pages)
      
sometimes the same person performs both the generation and
referencing the documentation.  however, the more common case
is that of an api publisher producing javadocs for the api
user who references them.

ashkelon is also composed of two parts, very similar to
javadoc:

  1. the repository manager, used to populate (and otherwise
    manage) a database (an rdbms) with documentation 
    information
    
  2. the viewer application, a web app that provides access to 
    the documentation in a variety of ways (search, browse,
    cross-reference, etc..).  this app is in some ways markedly
    different from javadoc's gui.
    
in an intranet environment, an administrator might be
responsible for using the repository manager to populate
a database with api docs.  the development team would
probably select a number of api's to populate including

  a. internal company code
  b. popular third party api's (from jakarta, 
     sourceforge, or other)
  c. sun api's (j2se, j2ee, etc..)

the entire development team would use the viewer application
as an aid in development.

an important difference with ashkelon is that as an administrator,
you will use the repository manager repeatedly to add new api's
into the repository.  you don't have to (and should not try to)
add all api's in one step.

in an internet environment, it is conceivable that a single
high-availability site be made available to the general
java developer community.  such a site might provide api
publishers with online tools to register and populate their 
api's in this "global" repository.  the end-result would be
publicly-accessible java api documentation for many api's
which would be constantly kept up-to-date by the various
api publishers.
 
Administrator Guide - using the repository manager
--------------------------------------------------

At present (ashkelon v0.8), the repository manager is
a command-line tool whose interface was designed to mirror
the interface of the javadoc command line tool (the java
documentation generator).

If you are not familiar with using the javadoc command
line tool, it is recommended that you take a little
time to familiarize yourself with it.  Every distribution
of J2SE comes with javadoc tool documentation, accessible
from the page in:
  $JAVA_HOME/docs/tooldocs/solaris/javadoc.html
    or 
  $JAVA_HOME/docs/tooldocs/win32/javadoc.html
  
Alternatively this information is available from the javadoc
site at 
  http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/tooldocs/windows/javadoc.html
 or
  http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/tooldocs/solaris/javadoc.html

Aside from this command-line tool, in a future version I plan to 
provide a web application that will provide a graphical user interface
to manage the repository content.  Likewise, in a future version
I plan to provide an ANT task for integrating ashkelon with a continuous
build process.

The ashkelon command-line tool is called "ashkelon".  The code is 
a shell script wrapper around a java program.  On win32, the file
is ashkelon.bat while on unix it's ashkelon.sh or ashkelon.  This file 
resides in $ASHK_HOME/bin

After installation of ashkelon (see the file install.txt), you
should be able to run ashkelon from the command line:

> ashkelon

which should produce something similar to this output:

Ashkelon Repository Manager

Description:
  Manages a Java Documentation Repository.
  For more information, visit http://www.dbdoc.org/
  
Usage:
  ashkelon [add [javadoc options] <items> | remove <names> | reset | list]

    add      Add items to repository where items is the names of packages
             and/or source files to be added to the repository
    remove   Remove names from repository.  A name is the fully
             qualified name of a java package, class, or interface
    reset    Reset repository (i.e. delete everything, use with care)
    list     List package names currently existing in the repository

Items Reference
  items = [packagenames] [sourcefiles] [@files]
    packagenames
      A series of package names, separated by spaces, such as:
        java.lang java.lang.reflect java.awt
      You must separately specify each package you want to document.
      Like javadoc, ashkelon uses -sourcepath to look for these package
      names.  Wildcards are not allowed
    sourcefiles
      A series of source file names, separated by spaces, each of which
      can begin with a path and contain a wildcard
    @files
      One or more files that contain packagenames and sourcefiles
      in any order, one name per line
    
Supported javadoc options:
  -overview <file>          Read overview documentation from HTML file
  -public                   Show only public classes and members
  -protected                Show protected/public classes and members (default)
  -package                  Show package/protected/public classes and members
  -private                  Show all classes and members
  -sourcepath <pathlist>    Specify where to find source files
  -classpath <pathlist>     Specify where to find user class files
  -bootclasspath <pathlist> Override location of class files loaded
                            by the bootstrap class loader
  -extdirs <dirlist>        Override location of installed extensions
  -verbose                  Output messages about what Javadoc is doing
  -locale <name>            Locale to be used, e.g. en_US or en_US_WIN
  -encoding <name>          Source file encoding name

You will primarily use the ashkelon tool to add content to your
database.  However, there are four main commands the this tool
currently supports:

  ashkelon add - use to add api's to your database
  ashkelon reset - use to nuke the contents of the database
    (start from scratch)
  ashkelon list - lists the api's currently documented
    in the database
  ashkelon remove - opposite of ashkelon add, use it to remove
    api's from the repository
    

"ashkelon reset" and "ashkelon list" are really easy to use.  they
require no other parameters to function.

"ashkelon add" is richer.  let's talk about "ashkelon add".

documenting source code
-----------------------

  traditionally (i.e. with javadoc) one documents a single 
  api.  so the inputs to the javadoc tool are a list of 
  package names, such as {java.lang, java.io, java.net, ..}
  etc..
  
  when documenting multiple api's in a single repository,
  it's important to also keep track of what api each java
  package belongs to.  that is, org.apache.tools.ant is 
  part of the ant api whereas org.apache.log4j is part of
  the log4j api.
  
  the ashkelon project has devised a simple xml structure
  (no, i haven't written an xml schema for it [yet]) to 
  describe an api.  here's a sample (more samples are available 
  in the apis/ folder) for the servlet api (file name is 
  servlet.xml):

  <?xml version="1.0" ?> 
  <api>
  <name>Servlet 2.3 & JSP 1.2</name> 
  <summarydescription>
   JavaTM Servlet technology provides web developers with a simple, consistent 
   mechanism for extending the functionality of a web server and for accessing 
   existing business systems.

   JavaTM Servlet technology provides web developers with a simple, consistent 
   mechanism for extending the functionality of a web server and for accessing 
   existing business systems. A servlet can almost be thought of as an applet 
   that runs on the server side -- without a face. Java servlets have made many 
   web applications possible.

  <download_url>http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/</download_url> 
  <release_date>2001-08-13T08:00:00.000</release_date> 
  <version>2.3</version>
  <package>javax.servlet</package> 
  <package>javax.servlet.http</package> 
  <package>javax.servlet.jsp</package> 
  <package>javax.servlet.jsp.tagext</package> 
  </api>

  Notice that:
   - api has a one-to-many relationship with java packages.  that is, that
    an api is usually comprised of one or more java packages.

  This file is similar to the package.html file that you usually have to
  write for javadoc package documentation.  except that this file is 
  xml-based and thus more structured, and easier to interpret by a
  program.

  These xml api "descriptors" are the primary input to the ashkelon
  script (aside from the actual source code that you're trying to 
  document).  So you'll need to construct them.  The xml file for
  the api you need may already exist in the apis/ folder.  If it
  doesn't email the asheklon-devs@lists.sourceforge.net mailing
  list and someone will build one for you (if it's a public api,
  not your internal code).
  
  TIP: almost every API you'll need to populate into ashkelon has
   had javadocs created for it before.  when javadoc is run on a list
   of packages, it leaves a signature in a file called "package-list"
   (check it out, go to $JAVA_HOME/docs/api and you'll see the file).
   Use this list of packages is input to building your api xml file.
   
  So constructing such an xml file is easy:  provide a description,
   url, version number, and other such information.  most importantly,
   provide the names of the java packages that comprise the api.
   save the file as <apiname>.xml (you might also want to consider
    contributing the file by cvs add/commit <apiname>.xml to the 
    ashkelon apis/ folder).
  
  Now you're ready to feed it into ashkelon:
  
  > ashkelon add @<apiname>.xml
  
  real example:
  
  > ashkelon add @servlet.xml
  
  ashkelon will take it from here.  it will invoke the javadoc engine
  to parse the source code and produce an object model of the
  information, and ashkelon will take the information and stuff it
  into the database.  depending on the speed of your machine and
  the size of the api, the whole process might take 5-10 seconds
  or 2-3 minutes.
  
  NOTE:  when populating, you might get a ton of junk warnings
   from the javadoc engine.  this is normal.  a lot of people
   will make typographical mistakes in their doc tags like
   write "@thorws SomeException" instead of "@throws SomeException"
   which javadoc will warn you about.
   If it's your code, you can correct the tag and repeat the
   add step (actually, make sure to read on about this).

How to replace an api that is already in the database
-----------------------------------------------------

  Well, there's two ways:

    1. nuke everything and start over
     > ashkelon reset
     > ashkelon add @api1.xml
     > ashkelon add @api2.xml
     > ...
     > ashkelon add @apin.xml
     
    2. differential:
     > ashkelon remove @apii.xml
     > ashkelon add @apii.xml
     
  If your environment uses nightly builds, you'll probably
  do [1] above nightly.
     
J2SDK1.4 caveats
----------------

  j2sdk1.4 introduces a new keyword "assert" into the java
  language.  in order to get ashkelon to populate api's that
  use the assert keyword without failing, you need to pass
  an extra flag to the ashkelon script, like so:
  
  > ashkelon add -source 1.4 @j2sdk14.xml

  TIP:  any flag that javadoc accepts will be passed 
   through to javadoc by ashkelon.  remember, ashkelon uses
   javadoc under the hood.  ashkelon plugs in to javadoc
   as a doclet.  ashkelon does not need to explicitly
   know about the flag (it will pass it through).


what's this about "sourcepath"?
-------------------------------

  so, when ashkelon runs, it needs to know where to find
  your source code.  the environment variable "sourcepath"
  is analogous to "classpath" which we're all familiar with.
  
  it's a colon-delimited (unix) or semicolon-delimited
  list of paths where you keep the source code for the apis
  you want to document.
  
  note:  if you don't have source code for what you
    want to document, you're out of luck.
  
  TIP: sun makes available the source code for j2se, j2me,
   and j2ee (and a bunch of other stuff) at:
      http://wwws.sun.com/software/communitysource/
      
  Even though it's not open source, nothing stops you from
   being able to document and publish sun java api's within
   an intranet.

dealing with very large api's (i.e. j2se)
-----------------------------------------

  if you look at ashkelon.bat or ashkelon.sh, you'll notice
  something a little alarming:
  
    java -Xmx100m
     or
    java -Xmx150m
    
  this means that when ashkelon runs, it requests 100 or
  150 MB of memory to run with.  it probably doesn't need
  that much memory.  but in some cases, j2se, it may
  need even more!
  
  this has nothing to do with ashkelon.  the javadoc
  tool requires similar amounts of ram.
  

  but since ashkelon allows you to build a repository
  in incremental steps, you can actually break up an
  api into multiple package sets and populate an api
  in small chunks, thus lowering the memory requirements
  of the application.
  
  so, here's a trick for populating j2se in chunks:
  
    i assume you've already created a j2se.xml file
    (actually there already is one in apis/)
    
    let's say we want to break up j2se into three
    sets of packages:  java.* , javax.*, and org.*
    
    you can create java.plist, javax.plist, and
    org.omg.plist files (the names are immaterial).
    these files are just a list of package names
    that you want to populate.
    
  you can now do this:
    > ashkelon add @java.plist
    > ashkelon add @javax.plist
    > ashkelon add @org.omg.plist
    > ashkelon add @j2se.xml
       (packages already added so won't be 
         repopulated, only api info (descr, version, etc..)
         will be added)

  
ashkelon system architecture
----------------------------

  two very good references on how ashkelon was architected
  & designed are:
    1. an online article published on java.sun.com in july
      of 2003:
        http://java.sun.com/features/2002/07/dbdoc.html
        
    2. a corresponding ppt presentation which was a javaone
     alternate talk in 2001 at:
        http://www.uptodata.com/1145suez.pdf
        

database schema description
---------------------------
 [ to be written ]
 
 i have created a diagram (pdf) representing the database
 schema used by ashkelon.  see $ASHK_HOME/doc/ERD.pdf
 
 the script that constructs the schema for a given database
 is located in $ASHK_HOME/db/$dbtype/org/ashkelon/db/ashkelon.sql
 

future versions / features

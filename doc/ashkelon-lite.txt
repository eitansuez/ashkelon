notes to self (until i automate the production of the ashkelon lite
 war file):

to build war file:
 build as usual
 expand it
 copy db into WEB-INF/db (db.conf, data, and log)
 rm META-INF
 comment out cls_info "Source Code" span block
 revise web.xml sourcepath (make it blank)
 re-war file as ashkelon-lite.war

-------
goals:

  1. automate production of ashkelon-lite war file
  2. instead of putting war file for upload, wrap it in a zip or tgz
    so that you can include a readme with it.  also it would fix the
    download problem i've experienced with the safari browser
